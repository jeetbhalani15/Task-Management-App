Features:

1. Task List: Display a list of tasks. Each task should show the task title and its status (completed or not completed).
2. Add Task: Provide an input field and a button for adding new tasks. When a user enters a task title and clicks the add button, the task should be added to the task list
3. Mark Task as Completed: Allow users to mark a task as completed. Completed tasks should be visually distinct from incomplete tasks (e.g., through strikethrough text or a different color).
4. Edit Task: Provide an option for users to edit the title of an existing task. Ensure that the updated title is reflected in the task list
5. Delete Task: Allow users to delete a task from the list.

6. Persisting Tasks: Implemented a way to persist tasks between page reloads using local storage.
7. Task Filters: Added functionality to filter tasks by their status (all, completed, incomplete)
